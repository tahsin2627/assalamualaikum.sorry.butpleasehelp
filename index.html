            <h1>Hey (srryyy) Assalamualaikum</h1>
            <p>I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share something that’s been on my heart for a while.</p>
            <p>I truly care about your friend, I love her. This isn't something casual or sudden. It's a feeling that’s grown deeply and sincerely within me. I believe Allah puts certain people in our lives for a reason, and I feel like she is one of those blessings.</p>
            <p>Right now, I’m doing my best to grow and improve. Alhamdulillah, I have a job, and I’m working hard to become stable emotionally, financially, and spiritually. My goal is simple: to build a peaceful home filled with love, sincerity, and faith.</p>
            <p>I’m not perfect, but I’m trying — with full trust in Allah’s plans. All I ask is for a little time, a little faith… and a little prayer. Please pray for me, for us 🙏 that Allah guides our hearts, and if it's meant to be, makes a way for it.</p>
            <p>Thank you for listening:))) she is so beautifullllyy cute women, SHE really means a lot to me....</p>
            <p>Take care, Assalamualaikum.</p>
